				<p class='introduction'>Our project took off with the help of Engineers for A Sustainable World (ESW), another UC Berkeley organization that Project RISHI had decided to partner with for the water project. The foundation for the "water project" didn't really exist aside from test samples of water from the previous India Trip which showed evidence of an E Coli. contamination as well as a question of whether a water quality project of this scale was even within Project RISHI's capability. I mean we were talking about potentially changing the quality of water for over 250 families. Fall Semester of 2014 was spent researching potential solutions that were both sustainable and financially viable, at the conclusion of which we narrowed down the most promising option, biosand water filters. The decision was initially made on these premises: the lifetime of the filters (30 years), the cost per filter (60 USD), ease of maintenance, and availability of needed materials in the locality. At this point, Project RISHI was aiming to build and implement the biosand water filters ourselves with the cooperation of the villagers. This was where we ran into several major issues. First, none of us on the water project (both Project RISHI and ESW) had any idea how to make a biosand water filter. Luckily, we found organizations that could help us with that.  We realized that building the biosand filters, implementing them in the village, and educating the villagers with just RISHI members, even with the cooperation of the villagers, was going to be nearly impossible. The time frame of 3 weeks, our lack of expertise, and the capital investments like a steel metal mold made properly implementing 2, let alone our minimalistic goal of 5, biosand filters seem so far out of reach.</p>

				<p>To move forward, we needed to form partnerships, most likely with a nonprofit organization that specifically worked in water sanitation. Fortunately for us, we  finally found SATHI.  With this partnership, we were able to far surpass our initial goal; our trial run implementation expanded to 20 biosand filters in Pudli.</p>
				 
				<p>As we watched the distribution of the filters in Pudli, it seemed that our work in the village… our personal work was done. We simply watched as SATHI and the villagers interacted in one of the most special experiences I have had thus far in Project RISHI. We were, in essence, no longer necessary for the success of the project at that point, and that was precisely our goal. We had successfully connected the villagers of Pudli to a non-profit whose vision included long-term sustainability.</p>
				 
				<p>Our long-term goal remains to provide access to clean water to every family in Bharog Baneri. As a senior, I'm so grateful to have been a part of this endeavor, and I know that RISHI will continue working towards this goal in partnership with SATHI and the villagers we have come to know and admire. I know I will look back in the future and be able to proudly say that this group's work is what led to such a significant change in Bharog Baneri.</p>

				<p class='introduction'>The Land Development project was inspired by a conversation we had with Vrijinder, our primary contact in Bharog Baneri. He explained that there were several plots of land (~3000 bighas total, which is equivalent to 1200 acres) located in the first ward of the village, called Pudli. Many farmers in the area had attempted varied means to use this extensive land for agricultural projects, but had been unsuccessful thus far. Our committee discovered that this land was divided amongst approximately 50 farmers who, ultimately, wanted to grow crops and distribute their produce to a wider market in order to earn income.</p>

				<p>During the school year, we got in contact with several of the farmers and grew to understand that there was an increasing demand for cultivation of the available land. We endeavored to look for an organization near the village that would be able to test the soil and determine its viability during our 2015 India trip. We came into contact with HIMOARD, based in Rampur, Himachal Pradesh, and started corresponding with its president, Dr. Minhas. Project RISHI and three representatives from HIMOARD, including Dr. Minhas, agreed to meet in Pudli to assess the soil in early June.</p>

				<p>After speaking to most of the farmers and surveying the land in Pudli over the Summer of 2015, HIMOARD advised Project RISHI and the farmers that the best route going forward was to apply for organic certification. According to Dr. Minhas, after three years undergoing HIMOARD's certification process, the farmers would receive organic certification from the government, which would allow them to sell their produce for double the price and make profits that would give farmers economic independence and provide local families with consistent income.</p>

				<p>At this point, we decided to request expert advice from an experienced social sector consultant serving on Project RISHI's national board. During that meeting, the Land Development committee was encouraged to consider alternative options alongside its pursuit of organic cultivation nonprofits. To do this, the committee fractured into 2-3 person subcommittees. Each subcommittee's goal was to establish a mini-project proposal including projected budgets and timelines. Operating in smaller groups allowed committee members to take better advantage of on-campus resources including access to academic experts and Blum Center research outlets. While the bulk of subcommittee work was conducted over winter break, frequent and meaningful dialogue allowed subcommittees to prepare presentations for return in January.</p>

				<p>After carefully considering the options generated by our subcommittees, the Land Development Team is currently still looking into several organizations for partnership, but has narrowed its overall project objective to the cultivation of the available land. Upon honing in on this more targeted goal, the Land Development Team has established contact with several prospective NGOs and remains optimistic about its upcoming endeavors as the semester progresses.</p>

				<p class='introduction'>UC Berkeley's Women's Empowerment Committee was first formed as a Clinton Global Initiative University project back in 2014. The founding members - Rupali Sood, Pooja Lalchandani, and Sanjana Sathya - wanted to address a major challenge in Bharog Baneri: the lack of empowerment for women. Women, although receive education till high school, are often not given the support and mentorship to enter into a formal career. They often end up staying in the village as housewives, tending to their family farms.</p>

				<p>However, the Mahila Mandal offers an avenue for women to connect and collaborate on their common love for basket-weaving. Rita Rani, the leader of the Mandal, was originally from a neighboring town before she came to Bharog Baneri to train women on the art of basket-weaving. Through her passion and leadership, the Mandal expanded to almost 50 women. The Mandal now creates multiple products such as baskets, coasters, and hats, all made from date leaves, pattha.</p>

				<p>While their products are made with care and talent, they have not been able to make much revenue. They lack a steady market to sell their products to, largely due to the fact that the villagers themselves don't have the disposable income to buy such “luxury goods.” Therefore, the vision of the UC Berkeley RISHI's Women's Empowerment Committee is to help connect these products to larger markets in India and the US. We hope to help them establish sustainable, long-term partnerships with markets so that they can achieve financial independence.</p>

				<div class='paneltitle' style='font-size:14px;'>Occular Care</div>
				<p class='introduction'>In Fall of 2013, our team analyzed general health surveys and patient conversations that were conducted in Bharog Baneri in 2012. We determined that specialized healthcare was deficient in the village, and that ocular issues were not being addressed; these issues were especially important considering that the village has a high elevation which exposes the farmers to abnormally high levels of UV radiation. We partnered with optometrists and ophthalmologists from Retina India, an NGO which works to implement ocular camps in areas around the world, to conduct our own ocular health camp in Bharog Baneri in summer of 2014. Our goal was to ascertain the status of ocular health in the village through the analysis of data collected at the camp. As this was also a VRI (Village Relations Initiative), one aspect of the project was to establish trust with the village. In the subsequent data analysis we found an absence of diabetes-related ocular diseases and a prevalence of cataracts most likely associate with the high altitude UV exposure. </p>

				<p>More villagers than we ever expected were present at the ocular camp, with people lined up outside up to an hour before the PHC was planned to open. The crowded PHC, lack of air conditioning, and chaotic environment meant that several of our team members quickly became dehydrated. Many villagers complained that they had to wait too long to be seen by a doctor, especially since they had traveled for hours from areas surrounding, but far from, the PHC. Despite these unforeseen obstacles, the health camp was incredibly rewarding both for the RISHI team and the villagers. Many of the villagers thanked us for putting the time and effort in to improve their health, and we were able to diagnose and recommend treatment for over 150 villagers. Leveraging the lessons we learned at this camp, our team was able to conduct an even more successful, organized, and well-attended camp the following year. </p>

				<div class='paneltitle' style='font-size:14px;'>Dental Care</div>
				<p>In Fall of 2014, we began working on a dental camp to address the lack of dental hygiene and awareness in the village. Because the ocular camp was more targeted towards the adult population, we marketed this camp mainly towards children and families. Project RISHI partnered with the Himachal Institute of Dental Sciences to conduct a three-day dental camp in the village, again at the Primary Health Center, in summer 2015. Skits related to dental education were conducted to raise awareness about dental hygiene; children learned about the importance of keeping teeth healthy as well as about how to properly brush their teeth, using teeth models and toothbrushes. In addition, the dental professionals performed cleanings, treated cavities, and completed invasive dental surgeries as necessary.  The momentum from the previous camp allowed for a higher turnout rate and even greater receptivity. </p>

				<p class='introduction'>The roots of the Education Committee trace back to 2013, and its focus was on the school-aged children in Bharog Baneri During the summer of 2014, we donated toys and supplies to the Anganwadis around Bharog Baneri, organized a Community Development Day focused on cleaning up trash within the village, and initiated a Pen Pals program. During our visit to the village's secondary school, we coordinated an event called Leadership Day, during which we engaged in conversation with the students about what problems they see in their village, what they potentially wanted Project RISHI to do, and how they perceived our role in their village. Perhaps the best part of our visit to the school was getting to talk to all the excited kindergarteners. Especially for the RISHI members who did not speak Hindi and usually needed translators, this was one of those rare instances where language didn't matter. In interacting with these kids, excitement was the common language and every member was able to connect to the village a little bit more. I mean, who could not be affected by Gayatri's infectious smile and Nikhil's dissipating fear of the huuuge bhaiya? It was Fall following the 2014 India trip, that all of these project aims were compiled into one Education Committee.</p>

				<p>We established the students and schools as the primary focus for our projects. It was from this point onwards that the Education Team gained steam. The Anganwadi project ended as a VRI (Village Relations Initiative), and the remainder of the funding was allocated for various other RISHI projects to maximize their impact.</p>

				<p>The 2015 India Trip consisted of two projects: Leadership Day and Student Learning Materials (SLM). During the second annual Leadership Day, we developed a stronger relationship with the students and learned so much more about their village. One of the activities of the day involved the students drawing their village to aid RISHI in understanding how these young minds envision Bharog Baneri. Though we also donated school supplies for students as an additional VRI,the Education Committee is moving towards developing more sustainable and long term projects for the schools in the village.</p>

				<p>For the upcoming India trip of 2016, the Education Committee's goals include providing workshops and supplies for the teachers, collecting quantitative and qualitative data, and creating a strong relationship with a student organization called NSS (National Service Scheme) in the secondary school. Ultimately, we want to gain an understanding for the reasons behind the significant dropout rate among students progressing from 10th grade to 11th grade. We hope that finding a sustainable solution for the dropout rate will become a future RMP (RISHI Methodology Project). We can't wait to see what RISHI is able to implement and learn this summer!</p>
